# Huffman Coding File Compression Program

## Overview
This C++ program implements Huffman coding algorithm to compress text data files. Huffman coding is a widely used method for lossless data compression. It assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters, resulting in efficient compression.

## Features
- **File Compression**: Compresses text files using Huffman coding algorithm.
- **File Decompression**: Decompresses previously compressed files, restoring the original text data.
- **Efficient Compression**: Achieves high compression ratios by assigning shorter codes to frequently occurring characters.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for compression and decompression operations.

## Note
- This program is designed specifically for text data compression. It may not work efficiently for binary data or other types of files.
- Compression ratios may vary depending on the input text file. Files with more repetitive patterns or frequent characters will achieve higher compression.
